# Introduction
A python tool for for two primary purposes:

 1) Mining protein-protein interactions labelled with post-translational
 modifications (PTM) and/or signalling function from various databases
 such as KEGG and HPRD.

 2) Provide machine learning and classification functionallity on proteins
 encoded by UniProt-KB accession numbers to learn and classify the
 PTMs/Singalling function of protein-protein interactions.

This can be used as a command line tool with the provided scripts, or custom
made scripts. Alterantively, the tool can be integrated into an existing
project using the simple API described in the examples.

# Install
